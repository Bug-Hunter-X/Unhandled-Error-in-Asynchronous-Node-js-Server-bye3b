# Unhandled Error in Asynchronous Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications: improper error handling in asynchronous operations. The server simulates an asynchronous task that might fail, but it doesn't catch and handle the potential error, resulting in an unhandled exception that could lead to the server crashing or unexpected behavior.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to implement error handling using `try...catch` blocks or event listeners.
